## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Workspace bootstrap: crate skeletons, quality gates, and the day-one architectural
  decision records. No parsing, recurrence, or scheduling logic yet.
- Five architectural decisions from the design bake-off — allocation policy, parser layering
  and the pull API, the error and diagnostic model, shared resource limits, and civil-time
  arithmetic — and a per-crate design document for each crate's committed public surface.
- `ical-grammar`, holding the content line grammar and the diagnostic vocabulary below
  `ical-core`, so a linter or a fuzz harness never compiles the typed model.

### Changed

- The purity gate reads the package a dependency links rather than the key it was written
  under. A `package = "..."` rename defeated every leg of the old gate; it is now a violation
  in both the inline and the sub-table spelling, alongside a dependency taken from a registry
  and a `no_std` crate missing from the gate's own crate list.
